### Hi there, name's Clutch :wave:

I am anything tech enthusiast that gets excited over everything tech, espicially anything to do with linux , open source, networking or electronics. I am actually big into gaming too,  but due to upcoming exams it is currently not my mind. I also very much like custom keyboards and am currently using a cheapino to write this.
